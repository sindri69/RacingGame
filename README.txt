We have created a 3D enviroment with a randomly generated maze. The maze has no cycles.
Within the maze is a ball that moves around semi randomly. We implemented collision detection with the walls of the maze and with the ball as well.
If you collide with the ball it changes colour.

The 3D enviroment has two positional lights and one directional light.

We also made a minimap of sorts.

Controls: W - Forward, S - Backwards, A - Look to the left, D - Look to the right
